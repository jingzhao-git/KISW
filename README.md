# README--KISW

## Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app.
In the process of establishing the program, there are mainly the following problems:
1. The front-end format is not applied to all pages, so logical statements are needed to handle the difference in format.
2. The design of the data schema. The relationship between the user and the question and answer needs to be considered. Especially the question is visible to everyone, but the answer is not.
3. Whether the rails version is compatible with the gem version. Such as bootstrap and rails6

The current problem is that users cannot search for similar problems based on keywords.Users can only browse all questions and manually view the related questions. In addition, the absence of a classification system also causes inconvenience to the user experience.
## Why is it a problem that needs solving?
Because the user's question is not answered in time. Users can take a simpler way to check the answers to similar questions.Especially when the database is large enough, it is impossible to just look at the answers to your own questions.
